### Introduction to Data Science
* Unit taken in 2020 Semester 1

## Tools used:
* Jupyter Notebook (Python)
* R Programming
* Bash scripting (Unix terminal)

## Learning outcome:
1. Explain the role of data in different styles of business
2. Demonstrate the size and scope of data storage and data processing, and classify the basic technologies in use
3. Identify tasks for data curation and management in an organisation
4. Classify participants in a data science project: such as statistician, archivist, analyst, and systems architect
5. Classify the kinds of data analysis and statistical methods available for a data science project
6. Locate suitable resources, software and tools for a data science project

### Key Assignment Projects:
* [Assignment 1]() - Data exploration
  * Manipulate the data
  * Describe the data using basic statistics
  * Produce non-graphical and graphical visualisation to explore the data
  * Communicate your findings as business insights
  * Use a 3rd party tool to visualise (bonus)

* [Assignment 2]() - Data classification
  * Read and write data to a file in Python
  * Describe the data using basic statistics
  * Wrangle the data
  * Clustering and describe the output
  * Split your dataset into training and testing data for binary and multi-class classification
  * Conduct classification and communicate the output of your analysis
  * Experience independent model evaluation.

* [Assignment 3]() - Data classification
  * Read a reasonably large dataset
  * Process the dataset using BASH Shell Scripts
  * Conduct aggregation of the dataset content
  * Generate tidy data for further processing
  * Read data from a file in R
  * Generate appropriate visualisations in R and output to files
